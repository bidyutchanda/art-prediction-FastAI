# Predicting the type of art by using CNN and FastAI (Accuracy = 94%)
The Jupyter notebook contained in this repo predicts the type of art from the available classes (paintings, drawings, iconographies, sculptures and engravings) by being trained upon a set of 9000 images from a Kaggle dataset and using CNNs and [**fastai**](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).
